# Colour grid

A different kind of colour palette generator

## Why? 

To quote [Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/):

"Ever used one of those fancy color palette generators? You know, the ones where you pick a starting color, tweak some options that probably include some musical jargon like "triad" or "major fourth", and are then bestowed the five perfect color swatches you should use to build your website? . . .You can't build anything with five hex codes. To build something real, you need a much more comprehensive set of colors to choose from."

This colour palette generator will NOT give you multiple hues which will work together in your website. 

It instead takes one hue and gives you 100 options for different shades of lightness/darkness, and different saturations based on your single hue. 

This means you can build your website with a number of colour options from your base colour, and can give you the variety of light and saturation levels needed building webites and UIs. This speeds up development as you have a premade system of colours to choose from.

## How can I use colour grid?

You can either click the buttons in the grid to copy the hash code of your colour, or alternatively, generate 100 utility CSS Custom properties to copy into your CSS. You can use these in your app to specify the degree of lightness and saturation.

## Is this hosted somewhere? 

You can find the project hosted on my [personal website](https://www.elliotclyde.nz/colour-grid/). Feel free to use it:
